Project: spiders2 (revamp1-spiders)
Location: C:\Users\HP\code\guy4\feb\02\revamp1-spiders\v1

High-level state
- This is the BASE persistent Claude development environment for Haskell projects.
- Primary workflow is documented in CLAUDE.txt and QUICKSTART.txt.
- A recent migration was completed on 2026-01-25 (see SUMMARY.txt). The template builds successfully with `cabal v2-run template` and verifies via `template.out`.
- Next intended stage is FOXHUB integration (auto versioning, GitHub publishing, endpoint generation).

Key structure
- claude_project_1: template reference implementation
- claude_project_2: continuation slot
- versions/: immutable backups (do not edit)
- saves/: additional saves
- CLAUDE.txt: authoritative workflow rules and project structure
- QUICKSTART.txt: user guide and example session
- SUMMARY.txt: migration status and next-stage plan

Primary workflows (per CLAUDE.txt / QUICKSTART.txt)
- Create: new project from template; build with `cabal v2-run <name>`; verify `<name>.out` contains "<name> loaded"; write verbatim session transcript.
- Continue: copy latest claude_project_N to N+1 and run tests.
- Compress: back up to versions/ (excluding versions/ and saves/), prune redundant files, verify template build, create a test project.

Known issues / notes
- GHC warning about missing other-modules is cosmetic and can be ignored.
- Compression can fail due to locked directories; remove dist-newstyle or skip locked dirs.
- FOXHUB integration is explicitly called out as the next stage (see SUMMARY.txt), referencing local foxhub tooling and endpoint/diagram interface design.

Pointers for restart
- Start with CLAUDE.txt and QUICKSTART.txt to re-establish the workflow.
- Verify the template build: `cabal v2-run template` and check template.out.
- Identify the latest claude_project_N and continue from there.
